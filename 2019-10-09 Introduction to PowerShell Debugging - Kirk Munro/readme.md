## Introduction to PowerShell Debugging with Kirk Munro

Script troubleshooting doesn't have to be done with a bunch of Write-Host calls! PowerShell has a very rich debugger that can help you quickly get to the bottom of issues in your scripts, once you know how to use it. Don't be intimidated, learning how to use the debugger is easy, and once you know how, you'll be glad to have it as part of your scripting toolbelt. Attend this presentation to learn more!
