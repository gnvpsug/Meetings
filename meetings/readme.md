This folder contains `json` files for each meeting. These files are consumed by our CI/CD pipeline that triggers when a PR is merged into master.

This is the current format for file

```json
{
    "MeetingName": "",
    "TwitterDescription": "",
    "RedditDescription": "",
    "MeetupDescription": "",
    "Date": ""
}
```

Note: This is still being worked on.
